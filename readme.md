For this week, you are going to make a website for bikes. All the data for every bike is in the
array in the products.js file which you can find along the other files that are sent to you. The
pictures which you are going to use for this project are also sent, and they are named by the the
‘image’ ​ values in every object in the given array, therefore you ​ DON'T ​ have to change anything
in the given files.  
The web design should be ​ exactly ​ the same as it is shown in the video. You can see all of the
effects (on hover) and colors in the video. The cards for every bike should be created
dynamically with javaScript, looping through the array of objects. The sidebar on the left, the
menu & the footer ​ can ​ be created in HTML.  
On the left side, there is a sidebar containing ​ filters​ , which are going to ​ function ​ for the first
time, and you are going to make the functionality for them. (hint: array.filter) When you first
come to the website, the first filter named ​ 'Show all' ​ should be clicked, which is showing all of
the cards on the page. On click on ​ 'female' ​for example, you should filter the array, and only
cards which have ​ 'gender' ​ as ​ 'female' ​ should show up on the screen. On click on ​ 'male' ​apply
the same logic. When you click on some of the filters in the ​ 'Brand' ​ section, you should filter the
array and show the cards which have the corresponding ​ 'brand' ​ (which is the name of the filter).  
When you click on each filter, the name of the filter (in HTML) should become ​ bolder ​ and
colored ​ orange. (hint: use a CSS class for this)  
As you can see there are also ​ badges ​ for every filter. These badges show how many items are
in the corresponding filter. You can create all of them in HTML, and set them starting at 0 at 
first. You are going to make the functionality to fill the badges with ​ correct ​ numbers to show the
customer how many items are in the selected filter.  
**Note: ​ every ​ filter on the left side in the sidebar, should work using the logic from above. 
**Note: the web design should be made ​ exactly the same ​ as given in the video. 
**Note: the page is not responsive (only laptops) 
**Note: ​ DO NOT ​ change anything in the files, just write your own code. 
 
Scoring ​ : 
 
● ​ 1 point ​ for making the design ​ exactly ​ the same like shown in the video. (no excuses this
time, if you are not certain about anything - ​ ASK​ ).  
● ​ 3 points ​ if you create the cards ​ dynamically ​ and fill the badges with ​ correct ​numbers. 
● ​ 5 points ​ if you create the functionality for the ​ filters ​ on click on each of the filters (all of 
them should work).
